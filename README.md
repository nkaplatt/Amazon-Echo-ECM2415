# Amazon-Echo-ECM2415
Software Engineering CA - build a functional amazon echo.

In this scrum we created the graphical user interface and interactive on/ off button and mode.

When opening the project the echo is in the Off state, clicking the on button will turn the device on and the welcome sound will play, to indicate the on mode the button highlights green. To turn off click the button again and the echo is now in the off state.
